# Global Optimization by Uniform Random Global Search

Users who are unfamiliar with GOURGS should refer to the 
python version of this same software [pyGOURGS](https://github.com/pySRURGS/pyGOURGS). 
This is a C++/Cython port of pyGOURGS created for improved performance.

This software package solves problems whose solutions can be represented as 
n-ary trees. These problems are typically solved using genetic programming. 
For these problems, there is often little to no relationship between the data
structure representation of a candidate solution and the ultimate performance of 
the candidate solution, once the data structure representation has been 
evaluated to its human readable form. This makes pure random search an 
attractive algorithm with which to solve these kinds of problems. This software 
is aimed at engineers, researchers and data scientists working in data analysis 
and computational optimization.

## Features 

1. Developed and tested on C++11
2. Can be run in deterministic mode for reproducibility
3. Can also run an exhaustive/brute-force search
4. API is similar to that of the popular DEAP genetic programming software

## Installing

### On Ubuntu 18.04

Everything but the Boost C++ codes are preinstalled by your distribution. You can install boost using 

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
```

Copy the repository to your computer and install using terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/pySRURGS/cyGOURGS.git
cd cyGOURGS
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
bash install.sh
```

## Usage

Users of pyGOURGS are referred to the similarly named `ant.py` in `./cyGOURGS/examples/ant.py` which has an identical interface with the addition of the `cppimpl` flag, which uses the C++ cyGOURGS when `True` and which uses the python3 pyGOURGS when `False`. 

The manual page of the artificial ant problem solver can be generated by using `python3 ant.py -h`

```
usage: ant.py [-h] [-num_trees NUM_TREES] [-num_iters NUM_ITERS]
              [-freq_print FREQ_PRINT] [-deterministic DETERMINISTIC]
              [-exhaustive EXHAUSTIVE] [-multiprocessing MULTIPROCESSING]
              [-cppimpl CPPIMPL]
              output_db

positional arguments:
  output_db             An absolute filepath where we save results to a SQLite
                        database. Include the filename. Extension is typically
                        '.db'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -num_trees NUM_TREES  pyGOURGS iterates through all the possible trees using
                        an enumeration scheme. This argument specifies the
                        number of trees to which we restrict our search.
                        (default: 10000)
  -num_iters NUM_ITERS  An integer specifying the number of search strategies
                        to be attempted in this run (default: 1000)
  -freq_print FREQ_PRINT
                        An integer specifying how many strategies should be
                        attempted before printing current job status (default:
                        10)
  -deterministic DETERMINISTIC
                        should algorithm be run in deterministic manner?
                        (default: False)
  -exhaustive EXHAUSTIVE
                        should algorithm be run in exhaustive/brute-force
                        mode? This can run forever if you are not careful.
                        (default: False)
  -multiprocessing MULTIPROCESSING
                        should algorithm be run in multiprocessing mode?
                        (default: False)
  -cppimpl CPPIMPL      should use cpp implementation of algorithms?(True -
                        cpp False - python) (default: True)
```
